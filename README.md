## Blank New Tab Blank for Chromium-based browsers

Created to work around an issue with Brave where the creation of a new tab is causing the whole browser to hang (April 2020). Overriding the default new tab page with minimal blank page solves this problem.

Usage:
Clone the repository. Open "Extensions" under browser settings. Enable "developer mode". Load "unpacked extension" and select the extension directory in the cloned repo. Extension should load and be available for use. Open a new tab. Enjoy how quickly a new tab opens.
